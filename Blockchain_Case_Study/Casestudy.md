In current digital era, the use of internet has immensely increased with everything being easily accessible. However, there has been increase in frustration with growing list of passwords and login as well as growing security and privacy breaches, identity thefts and many more. According to the current [industry data](https://financialpost.com/news/fp-street/securekey-a-toronto-startup-with-big-name-backers-aims-to-slay-internet-security-dragon#:~:text=SecureKey%20was%20founded%20by%20Greg,earth%20in%20the%20dotcom%20crash.), an average individual has 25 passwords to handle. Moreover, [research predictions](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/more-2021-cybersecurity-predictions-every-service-without-mfa-will-suffer-a-breach/439430) for 2021 includes:

 * Internet of things devices such as smart TVs, baby monitors, house security systems will impose greater risk in houses and businesses.
 
 * Public sector and government ogranisations including schools and universities will face more threaths of ransomware which are capable of shutting down the whole system.
 
 * Corporate networks that are trying to support increased number of remote employees are vulnerable to security breaches as they are rushed to go remote and fail to implement basic security safeguards as well as poorly configured cloud infrastructure.

 * Increased number of organisation's implementing and accepting technologies that help their security teams increase their efficiency and decrease burnouts. 

According to the Mike Lloy, CTO of ReadSeal, the gamechanger in security industry is to take away something rather than adding additional widget. Likewise, the CEO of SecureKey excepts an increased use of digital ID in almost every industry from purchasing a house to checking healtcare details securely as the following would become a priortity in todays' day and age. Moreover, this current trend is predicted to grow in the near future; where digital ID ecosystem like Verified.Me will be essential globally.
